# Container for [NLM Form Builder](https://github.com/LHNCBC/formbuilder-lhcforms)

We provide a ready-made and frequently updated OCI container image for [NLM Form Builder](https://github.com/LHNCBC/formbuilder-lhcforms).
The [LHC-Forms](https://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/) widget is included and served from the container rather than the NLM website.

Refer to [compose.yaml](/compose.yaml) for a sample Compose file.
